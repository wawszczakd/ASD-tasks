# ASD tasks

This repository contains my solutions to tasks from the course "Algorithms and
Data Structures".

## Overview

ASD stands for "Algorytmy i Struktury Danych" in Polish, which translates to
"Algorithms and Data Structures". This repository includes my solutions to the
tasks from this course. All the solutions are written in C++. Unfortunately,
the task statements are not provided, but I believe they can be found somewhere
on [Szkopu≈Ç](https://szkopul.edu.pl/).
